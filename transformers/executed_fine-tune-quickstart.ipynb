This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

I give them kudos for all the cool unique combinations and fusions they came up with (Sriracha watermelon, anyone?) However, most of the other dishes were just too salty or spiced an incorrect amount. (Avoid the Chinese food, if you can even call it that). \\n\\nIn the end, I filled myself up with the mushroom pasta, which came in a cool metal ladle, and the steak.
